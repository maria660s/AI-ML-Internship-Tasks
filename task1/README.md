# Task 1: Exploring and Visualizing the Iris Dataset

## Objective
The goal of this task was to load, inspect, and visualize the Iris dataset to understand data trends and distributions.

## Dataset
The Iris dataset in CSV format (`iris.csv`) was used for this task.

## Steps Performed

1. **Load the dataset:**
   - Used pandas to load the CSV file.
   
2. **Data Inspection:**
   - Printed the dataset shape, column names, and first few rows using `.head()`.
   - Used `.info()` and `.describe()` for summary statistics.

3. **Data Visualization:**
   - Created scatter plots to explore relationships between features.
   - Used histograms to visualize value distributions of features.
   - Created box plots to identify potential outliers.
   - Used matplotlib and seaborn libraries for all visualizations.

## Skills Demonstrated
- Data loading and inspection using pandas
- Descriptive statistics and data exploration
- Basic plotting and visualization with seaborn and matplotlib
